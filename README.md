# Python Dimension Reduction Library

The repo contains some libraries below:

1. A self-customized unsupervised dimension reduction algorithm, Principal Component Analysis(_**PCA**_) and two supervised dimension reduction algorithms, Linear Discriminant Analysis(_**LDA**_) and Discriminant Component Analysis(_**DCA**_). 
2. Two _**Differentially Private PCA**_ algorithm implementation, regarding the paper [Analyze gauss: optimal bounds for privacy-preserving principal component analysis](http://kunaltalwar.org/papers/PrivatePCA.pdf) and [Private approximations of the 2nd-moment matrix using existing techniques in linear regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00056). 
3. A implementation of Differentially Private Distributed PCA. 

There are also some ongoing experiments code inside.
